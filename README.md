We use Monte Carlo simulation to price a Call option given a stock's current price, volatility, risk free rate, time to expiration and strike price. We also compute the call price using Black Scholes formula. We can see that MC estimates prices to be within ~0.5%-0.8% of those computed by Black Scholes, even with just 10,000 simulation paths.
